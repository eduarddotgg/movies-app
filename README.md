# Read Before Review

Before you start there few things I would like to share about my work.

Movie wikipedia description, link and imdb link - to be honest never tried to search for something with wikipedia 
api pr imdb. But my small research during this test showed me that they are very poor and not safe. Searching in 3 
databases can give unexpected results, so I decided to research a little more and found some API service that could 
link both Wikipedia and IMDb and that seemed for me more safe and more accurate search results. One problem it's 
free version has limit of 100 api calls I hope that will be enough for review.  

Due to limited amount of time and du to small project I had to choose simpler solutions.
If I had more time and the project would be bigger I could use for example some state management for example Redux 
or something else it depends. Also I would implement better api system with interceptors, better error handling etc.

As for UI to be honest I rarely work with open source UI libraries, mostly I worked with my own implementation that 
was better fit for my hobby projects or at my current workplace we also have our own UI libraries. But that doesn't 
stop me and the only thing I would like to let you know that my small research about Material UI showed me that it 
uses CSS-in-JS so that the reason why I decided to use CSS-in-JS. But i would be no problem for me to use any css.     


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
